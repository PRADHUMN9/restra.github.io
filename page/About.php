         <p>Whitmans Restaurant serves burgers and seasonal fare with a focus on fresh, local ingredients. Opened by native 			           New Yorkers, the concept was born by friends whose vision was to provide the neighborhood with delicious comfort           food in a cozy, intimate setting. The main attraction, modeled after the Minneapolis-originated phenomenon, the           “Juicy Lucy,” features two thin beef short rib blend patties pinched together encasing a scoop of pimento cheese,           the result: a molten core of cheese oozing from the patty. Whitmans introduced their take on the cult burger in           2010 to rave reviews. In addition, Whitmans offers a vast array of specialty crafted burgers including The Hound,           Spicy Patty, and The Mangold just to name a few.</p>
